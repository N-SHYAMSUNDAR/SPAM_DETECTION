The classification algorithms that we usally use need some sort of numerical feature vector in order to perform the classification task. There are actually many methods to convert a corpus to a vector format. The simplest is the bag-of-words approach, where each unique word in a text will be represented by one number.\n","\n","In this section we'll convert the raw messages (sequence of characters) into vectors (sequences of numbers).\n","\n","As a first step, let's write a function that will split a message into its individual words and return a list. We'll also remove very common words, ('the', 'a', etc..). To do this we will take advantage of the NLTK library. It's pretty much the standard library in Python for processing text and has a lot of useful features.
